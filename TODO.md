# To Do

## New Feature - Devil's Deal
    - The percentage chance for this to occur are configurable in the game mode configuration, along with the percentage of additional credits it will cost.
    - on the game table screen, roll to see if the random chance for this feature occurs. 
    - If the feature is deemed to occur, determine 3 cards in the deck that would make the best possible hand and pick a random value.
    - To the right of the last card in the hand, floating out of the flex container, show this card with the text "Can I offer you a deal?". 
    - The card and text should be ghostly - bobbing in all directions slowly, but always coming back to its center point, and the opacity should also animate from 50% to 75%.
    - Under that text, calculate the payoff of that best possible hand, multiplied by the number of parallel hands that are set to be run, and add 10% to that value.
    - If the player holds this card, deduct the amount calculated in the results screen and show a new "Devil's Deal" line showing the cost of that card, and add it into the final profit calculation on the round.
    - There will be a new shop option to increase the chances of the Devil's Deal to occur by 5% every time it is purchased, with a maximum amount of times set in the game mode configuration.
    - There will be a new shop option to reduce the cost of the Devil's Deal by 6% every time it is purchased, with a maximum amount of times it can be purchased set in the game mode configuration.
